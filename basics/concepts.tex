\chapter{Basic Concepts}
When you first open OmniGraffle, there's a lot to absorb,
but you can boil down the interface into four main areas: the Toolbar, Sidebar, \mbox{Inspectors}, and the Canvas.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{res/og7_concepts_hero.png}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The \textbf{Toolbar} contains the tools you use to create the things you draw.
  \item The \textbf{Sidebar} is where you organize the canvases, layers, and objects within your document.
  \item The \textbf{Inspectors} are what you use to style the things you draw, and for setting up your project.
  \item The \textbf{Canvas} is where you draw things.
\end{itemize}

Yes, there's a lot more to it than that, and that's what this chapter is for;
to provide you with a gentle introduction to some of OmniGraffle's key components and concepts so you can
quickly get to work.

\section{OmniGraffle Glossary}
Every piece of software you use has a core set of terminology, and like those apps, OmniGraffle has a common
nomenclature. To better help you understand the terms and terminology used when describing the interface or
how to work in OmniGraffle, we're providing this brief \textit{lingua franca}.

\begin{description}[
      style=nextline,
    ]
  \item[Artboard] An \textit{artboard} is a special type of layer whose objects define an export area, or act
    as a container, for objects on \textit{standard} or \textit{shared layers} higher up in the layer stack.
  \item[Bounding Box] The rectangular area that defines the \textit{space} an object occupies on the canvas
    is known as the \textit{bounding box}. Bounding boxes have eight handles (one at each corner and
    centerpoint of the box), which you can click and drag to resize an object.
  \item[Canvas] The \textit{canvas} is the big white area in the center of OmniGraffle's interface where you
    draw and create things. An OmniGraffle project always contains at least one canvas and one layer.
  \item[Document/Project] When you create a new file in OmniGraffle, the basic type of file you can create is
    a \textit{document}. However, documents tend to be associated with wordy things, not designy things, so
    throughout the documentation, you'll see us reference these as \textbf{OmniGraffle Projects}.
  \item[Group] A \textit{group} consists of two or more objects that are bound to each other. An object
    group, when selected, can be styled and moved on the canvas as a single unit; the styles you apply using
    the Object inspectors are assigned to each object in the group.
  \item[Guides] There are two types of guides that you'll see in OmniGraffle:
    \begin{itemize}[
          leftmargin=1.5em,
        ]
      \item \textbf{Ruler Guides}, which are pink by default, are guides that you dra
      \item \textbf{Smart Guides}, which are light blue by default, appear when you are aligning objects on the canvas.
    \end{itemize}

    You can change the default colors of Ruler and Smart Guides by choosing
    \textbf{OmniGraffle} $\blacktriangleright$
    \textbf{Preferences} $\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Appearance}.

  \item[Inspector] You use an \textit{inspector} to define the styles and properties of an object, define the
    canvas area and units of measurement, and set document properties for saving and printing your OmniGraffle projects.
    The individual inspectors are contained in four separate \textit{tabs} of the Inspector Bar, located to
    the right of the canvas.
  \item[Inspector Bar] The \textbf{Inspector} bar is located to the right of the canvas. Similar to the
    Sidebar, the Inspector has four tabs which contain specific categories of inspectors:
    \begin{itemize}[
          leftmargin=3em,
        ]
      \item Use the \textbf{Object} inspectors to style, size, and arrange the objects you create.
      \item Use the \textbf{Properties} inspectors to define how and where lines connect to other objects. If
        you have OmniGraffle Pro, you can also add Notes and key-value metadata for the objects you create,
        and assign actions to objects.

        \begin{tcolorbox}[
            enhanced,
            colback=gray!10,
            colframe=gray!10,
            borderline west={2pt}{0pt}{green!60},
            boxsep=0pt,
            left=1em,
            right=1em,
            top=1.2em,
            bottom=0.8em,
            fonttitle=\bfseries\color{black},
            title=Tip,
            attach boxed title to top left={yshift=-0.8em, xshift=1em},
            boxed title style={
              colback=gray!20,
              colframe=gray!20,
              boxsep=0.3em,
              top=0.1em,
              bottom=0.1em
            }
          ]
          If you have two or more objects selected on the canvas, you can use any of the Object and
          Properties inspectors to apply style and property changes to the selected objects.
        \end{tcolorbox}

      \item Use the \textbf{Canvas} inspectors to define the selected canvas. If your project has multiple
        canvases, you can set each canvas's properties independently. The Canvas inspectors are used to set
        the canvas's dimensions, choose whether the canvas automatically expands when working on the canvas,
        set an \textit{infinite} canvas, assign a background color or image fill to the canvas, and more.
      \item Use the \textbf{Document} inspectors to define how your OmniGraffle project file is saved, set
        printer margins, and add document-wide metadata for the project. Unlike the Canvas inspectors, which
        can be set on a canvas-by-canvas basis, the settings you choose in the Document inspectors apply to
        the everything in your project.
    \end{itemize}

  \item[Keyboard Shortcut] A set of keys you press to invoke a menu command, or a single character or number
    key that you press to select one of OmniGraffle's tools. You can change OmniGraffle's default keyboard
    shortcuts by choosing OmniGraffle $\blacktriangleright$ Keyboard Shortcuts from the menu bar.
  \item[Layer] A layer contains the objects that you draw. There are three different types of layers in OmniGraffle:
    \begin{itemize}[
          leftmargin=3em,
        ]
      \item \textbf{Standard Layer} — this is the basic layer type, available in both OmniGraffle Standard and Pro.
      \item \textbf{Shared Layer} — shared layers are used to share objects with multiple canvases in your
        project. Shared layers are only available in OmniGraffle Pro.
      \item \textbf{Artboard Layer} — artboard layers contain a new object type in OmniGraffle Pro, the artboard.
      \item \textbf{Shared Artboard Layer} — an artboard layer that is shared with other canvases in the document.
    \end{itemize}
    Canvases can contain multiple layers of any type.
  \item[Layer Stack] The order in which layers appear in the \textit{sidebar}. When a canvas has multiple
    layers, those layers are stacked on top of each other. Layers can be repositioned in the stack by
    dragging them up or down in the sidebar.
  \item[Line] A \textit{line} can be a standalone object on the canvas, or used to connect two or more shapes
    together. To create a line, use the \textbf{Line tool}. Use the Stroke inspector to change the line's
    style properties, and the Line inspector to change the line type, apply line ends, and define how lines
    hop each other.
  \item[Movement Handle] A movement handle appears in the center of an object's bounding box after choosing
    \textbf{View} $\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Movement Handles} from the menu bar. Once enabled,
    \textbf{click-and-drag} on a Movement Handle to move an object on the canvas.
  \item[Object/Shape] The things you draw on the canvas are known as \textit{objects}. An object can be a
    shape that you draw with the Shape or Pen tools, a line that you draw with the Line tool, or a block of
    text or line label that you enter using the Text tool. If you have OmniGraffle Pro, you can also use the
    Artboard tool to add an artboard to your project, or to convert text and lines to shapes.
  \item[Ruler] Positioned to the left and above the \textit{canvas} are the rulers. The rulers reflect the
    units of measurement set in the Units inspector, and are initially based on the template used when
    creating a new OmniGraffle document. You can hide and show the rulers by pressing \textbf{Command-R}.
  \item[Sidebar] The \textit{sidebar} to the left of the canvas, is used for managing everything in your
    project. You can organize and rename the canvases, layers, objects, and groups of objects here. The
    sidebar has four tabs which you can click to switch between different things in your project:
    \begin{itemize}[
          leftmargin=3em,
        ]
      \item Use the \textbf{Layers} tab to organize and rename the canvases, layers, objects, and groups of
        objects in your project.
      \item Use the \textbf{Guides} tab to add, position, and change the colors of the guides you drag onto
        the canvas from the rulers.
      \item Use the \textbf{Outline} tab to rapidly create and label objects for a diagram or flow chart;
        things of a hierarchical nature.
      \item Use the \textbf{Selection} tab to select, style, and interact with objects based on their properties.
    \end{itemize}
  \item[Stencil] A \textit{stencil} is a reusable shape that can be dragged onto the canvas from the
    \textbf{Stencil Browser}. Stencils can be as simple as a square or triangle, or as complex as a
    multilayered and meticulously drawn illustration. For more details about stencils and the Stencil
    Browser, see Using, Curating, and Creating Stencils.
  \item[Stencil Browser] A means of accessing stencils in OmniGraffle. By default, the Stencil Browser is
    available in the right sidebar. However, you can also relocate the Stencil Browser to the left sidebar,
    view it as a popup menu from the toolbar, or use it as a floating window. For more details about stencils
    and the Stencil Browser, see Using, Curating, and Creating Stencils.
  \item[Stroke] A \textit{stroke} is the line that borders an object. To remove or apply styles to an
    object's stroke, or to a line created with the \textbf{Line tool}, use the \textbf{Stroke inspector}.
  \item[Subgraph] A subgraph is a special kind of group that can be expanded to show the hierarchy inside it,
    or collapsed to make it a single compact object.
  \item[Table] A table is a special kind of group that organizes rows and columns of objects.
  \item[Template] An OmniGraffle file type that contains the base settings, such as the canvas size and units
    of measurement, used when creating new OmniGraffle documents (\textbf{File} $\blacktriangleright$
    \textbf{New}). You can also apply a template's styles to an existing diagram by choosing \textbf{Format}
    $\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Choose Diagram Style}. Use the sheet that appears to select from one of
    OmniGraffle's templates to apply its styles to your project.
  \item[Toolbar, Tool Palette, and Tools] The region along the top of OmniGraffle's window is the
    \textit{toolbar}. The toolbar contains buttons for opening and closing the Sidebar (to the left of the
    canvas) and the Inspector sidebar (to the right of the canvas). In the middle of the toolbar, you'll find
    the \textbf{tool palette}, which contains the tools you use in OmniGraffle to select, draw, connect,
    create, and interact with objects.
\end{description}
Now that you have a better understanding of OmniGraffle's \textit{lingua franca}, it's time to dive in and
learn more about the basics of using OmniGraffle.

\section{Understanding the Canvas}
The canvas is where you create, edit, and move objects around in your project. By default, every OmniGraffle
document contains at least one canvas with one layer, and you can add as many canvases as you'd like.

Canvases give you the flexibility to separate your work into distinct areas within the same project file. Not
sure if you like how an illustration you've been working on is coming together? Duplicate the canvas and
apply a new set of styles so you can see which one you like best.

To work on a canvas, select the canvas by either clicking its name or the preview icon in the sidebar. When
you do, the preview icon takes on a light blue highlight, and any objects appear on the working canvas in the
middle of OmniGraffle's window.

To delete a canvas, select the preview image in the sidebar and then use one of the following options:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Press the \textbf{Delete} key;
  \item Choose \textbf{Edit} $\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Canvases} $\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Delete Canvas};
  \item \textbf{Control-/Right-click} on the preview icon and select \textbf{Delete} Canvas from the
    contextual menu; or,
  \item Choose \textbf{Delete Canvas} from the \textbf{Action} menu at the bottom of the Sidebar next to the
    Search field.
    \begin{tcolorbox}[
        enhanced,
        colback=gray!15,
        colframe=gray!15,
        borderline west={2pt}{0pt}{blue!80},
        boxsep=0pt,
        left=1em,
        right=1em,
        top=1.2em,
        bottom=1em,
        title=Note,
        fonttitle=\bfseries\color{black},
        attach boxed title to top left={yshift=-0.8em, xshift=1em},
        boxed title style={
          colback=gray!20,
          colframe=gray!20,
          rounded corners,
          boxsep=0.3em,
          top=0.1em,
          bottom=0.1em
        }
      ]
      OmniGraffle projects need at least one Canvas; you cannot delete the last one.
    \end{tcolorbox}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Configuring the Canvas}
When you create a new project in OmniGraffle, one of the first things you might consider doing is taking a
pass through the \textbf{Canvas Inspectors} (\textbf{Inspectors} $\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Canvas}).
These inspectors are fully defined in Working With the Inspectors, but here's a brief overview:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Canvas Size} — Use the Canvas Size inspector to choose a \textbf{Canvas Mode} (Fixed,
    Flexible, or Infinite),
    and define the printing options for this canvas.
    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{res/og7_insp_canvassize.png}
    \end{figure}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Fixed}: A canvas with its width and height set to a specific size; for example, $1024
        \times 768$ pixels.
      \item \textbf{Flexible}: A canvas which expands in a specified direction (up, down, left, or right) to
        suit your needs.
      \item \textbf{Infinite}: A canvas that extends infinitely in all directions.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Canvas Fill} — Use the Canvas Fill inspector to apply a fill color or pattern to the canvas.
    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{res/og7_insp_canvasfill.png}
    \end{figure}
  \item \textbf{Background Image} — Use the Background Image inspector to select and use an image as the background
    for the canvas.
    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{res/og7_insp_backgroundimg.png}
    \end{figure}

    \begin{tcolorbox}[
        enhanced,
        colback=gray!15,
        colframe=gray!15,
        borderline west={2pt}{0pt}{blue!80},
        boxsep=0pt,
        left=1em,
        right=1em,
        top=1.2em,
        bottom=1em,
        title=Note,
        fonttitle=\bfseries\color{black},
        attach boxed title to top left={yshift=-0.8em, xshift=1em},
        boxed title style={
          colback=gray!20,
          colframe=gray!20,
          rounded corners,
          boxsep=0.3em,
          top=0.1em,
          bottom=0.1em
        }
      ]
      If you choose to use both a Canvas Fill and a Background Image on the canvas, note that the Background
      Image sits in the foreground, above the Canvas Fill.

      Also, if you would like the Canvas Fill or Background Image to be included as part of any image export,
      be sure to uncheck \textbf{Transparent background} in the export panel. For more details, see Exporting Image
      and Graphics Files from OmniGraffle.
    \end{tcolorbox}

  \item \textbf{Units} — Use the Units inspector to define the units of measurement and how objects scale on the canvas.
    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{res/og7_insp_units.png}
    \end{figure}
  \item \textbf{Grid} — Use the Grid inspector to specify the distance between major (thicker) or minor (thinner) grid
    lines, their color, and whether shapes on the canvas will snap to the grid when moved into position.
    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{res/og7_insp_grid.png}
    \end{figure}
  \item \textbf{Diagram Layout and Style} — Use the Diagram Layout and Style inspector to turn \textbf{Auto
    Layout} on or off,
    to set how connected objects flow in a diagram, and to apply diagram styles to objects in the canvas.
    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{res/og7_insp_diagramlayout.png}
    \end{figure}
    See Diagramming Basics for a quick tutorial on diagramming in OmniGraffle.
  \item \textbf{Canvas Data} — Use the Canvas Data inspector to change the name of the current canvas, add a
    descriptive note, or to set key-value pairs of metadata to help further define your project.
    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{res/og7_insp_canvasdata.png}
    \end{figure}
    Some examples of changes you might want to make to the Canvas prior to starting your work include:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If you are creating diagrams and flowcharts, you might want to turn on \textbf{Auto layout} in
        the \textbf{Diagram Layout and Style} inspector.
      \item If you are creating icons for use in an app you're prototyping, you might want to use the \textbf{Units}
        inspector to set the \textbf{Ruler Units} to pixels, and then adjust the \textbf{Scale} according to
        the assets you
        need to export.
      \item If you want pixel-perfect alignment, you could change the \textbf{Major Grid Steps} to 1 px; each square
        in the grid is now 1 px $\times$ 1 px, which is perfect for creating pixel art.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
But the most interesting change you can make to the canvas comes up in the next section: \textit{Infinite Canvas}!

\subsection{Rulers and Ruler Units}
Bordering the Canvas—along the left and top edges—are the Rulers. You can also hide or show the rulers by
choosing View $\blacktriangleright$ Rulers (Command-R).

The point at which the rulers meet—the upper-left corner—is known as the Ruler Origin Point. This is the
point from which all ruler measurements originate; its coordinates are 0,0.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{res/og7_ruleroriginpoint.png}
\end{figure}
To change the origin, click and drag the origin from the corner where the rulers meet. Alternatively, you can
enter Origin values in the Units inspector. To reset the origin to the 0,0 position, click on the origin
point between the two rulers. Click the origin point again and the origin point changes to its previous position.

\begin{tcolorbox}[
    colframe=lightgray,
    colback=white,
    boxrule=1pt,
    arc=0pt,
    left=10pt,right=10pt,top=10pt,bottom=10pt,
  ]
  What Happens to the Canvas Origin with an Infinite Canvas?

  In earlier versions of OmniGraffle, the Canvas Origin—the point from which the canvas expands when
  autosizing—has always been designated as 0,0, the top-left corner of the canvas. But what happens to the
  Origin when you have an Infinite Canvas?

  With an Infinite Canvas, the \textbf{0,0} Origin still exists, but if you look closely at the rulers, you'll notice
  that the rulers extend into the negative space. This means that you can have an Origin of \textbf{0,-100}
  or \textbf{-100,0},
  or whatever you'd like.

  You can change the coordinates for the Origin point in the \textbf{Units} inspector, or you can temporarily move the
  Origin by clicking and dragging the \textbf{Origin Guides} out from the square above and to the left of the rulers:
  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{res/og7_infinitecanvas_sidebar01.png}
  \end{figure}

  The Origin Guides are great for helping you work in an infinite space. You can drag them out to an object
  and, effectively, reposition the rulers at the same time.
  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{res/og7_infinitecanvas_sidebar02.png}
  \end{figure}

  To reposition the Origin Guides to their previous position, just click the Origin point by the rulers again.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Changing Ruler Units to Suit Your Design Needs}
The rulers reflect the units of measure defined in the default template, but you can also change the \textbf{Ruler
Units} in the Units inspector (choose \textbf{Inspectors} $\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Canvas}).
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{res/og7_rulerunits01.png}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Pixels (px)
  \item Points (pt)*
  \item Picas (p)
  \item Millimeters (mm)
  \item Centimeters (cm)$^*$
  \item Meters (m)
  \item Kilometers (km)
  \item Inches, fractional ("or in$^*$)
  \item Inches, decimal (in)
  \item Feet (ft or ')
  \item Yards (yd)
  \item Miles (mi)
\end{itemize}
Ruler units followed by an asterisk $^*$ in the previous list means that these measurement types will print
true to size when selected.
\begin{tcolorbox}[
    enhanced,
    colback=gray!15,
    colframe=gray!15,
    borderline west={2pt}{0pt}{blue!80},
    boxsep=0pt,
    left=1em,
    right=1em,
    top=1.2em,
    bottom=1em,
    title=Note,
    fonttitle=\bfseries\color{black},
    attach boxed title to top left={yshift=-0.8em, xshift=1em},
    boxed title style={
      colback=gray!20,
      colframe=gray!20,
      rounded corners,
      boxsep=0.3em,
      top=0.1em,
      bottom=0.1em
    }
  ]
  The \textbf{Units} inspector also offers the option for you to set a custom Scale. For example, you could
  specify that 1 inch on the canvas is the equivalent to 10 feet, or for really long distances, 100 pixels
  could represent 93 million miles.
\end{tcolorbox}
You can also change the ruler units by Control- or Right-clicking on the ruler or the Canvas itself. For
example, Control-/Right-clicking on the Rulers provides you with options for hiding and showing the Rulers
and Guides, as well as changing the Ruler Units.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{res/og7_rulerunits02.png}
\end{figure}
While Control-/Right-clicking on the Canvas gives you quick access to other options, including the ability to
add or duplicate Canvases and Layers, and for controlling the Grid and Guides.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{res/og7_rulerunits03.png}
\end{figure}
Note that in both cases, the context menu displays the current setting next to the \textbf{Ruler Units} menu item.
The unit type specified in the template you choose, or as set in the Units inspector, determines how other
inspectors deal with units of measurement. For example, if Ruler Units are set to centimeters (cm), you will
see this unit of measurement reflected in the following inspectors:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Geometry
  \item Alignment
  \item Size
  \item Grid
  \item Diagram Layout and Style
  \item Margins
\end{itemize}

The Stroke, Shadow, Shape, Line, and Font inspectors specify their units in points (pt) regardless of the
Ruler Units setting.

\begin{tcolorbox}[
    enhanced,
    colback=gray!15,
    colframe=gray!15,
    borderline west={2pt}{0pt}{blue!80},
    boxsep=0pt,
    left=1em,
    right=1em,
    top=1.2em,
    bottom=1em,
    title=Note,
    fonttitle=\bfseries\color{black},
    attach boxed title to top left={yshift=-0.8em, xshift=1em},
    boxed title style={
      colback=gray!20,
      colframe=gray!20,
      rounded corners,
      boxsep=0.3em,
      top=0.1em,
      bottom=0.1em
    }
  ]
  See Working With the Inspectors later in this guide for more details about the individual inspectors.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Toolbar Basics}
Along the top of OmniGraffle's window is the \textbf{Toolbar}.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering

The toolbar has buttons for nearly every function in OmniGraffle. From buttons for opening and closing the
Sidebar and the Inspector bar, to the Tool Palette at its center, everything you need to work in OmniGraffle
is just one click away.

You use the tools in the Tool Palette to work on the canvas. For example, you use the Selection tool to
select and move objects, the Shape or Pen tools to draw shapes, the Line tool to draw lines or to connect
shapes in a diagram or flowchart together, or the new Point Editor tool to further customize the shapes you draw.

Above the Tool Palette, you'll see a \textit{document icon}. Next to that is the filename, and if your OmniGraffle
file has more than one Canvas, the filename is appended by a colon (:) followed by the name of the canvas
you're presently working on.

\end{figure}

If you \textbf{Command-click} on the document icon, you'll get a contextual menu that shows you where the file is stored
on your Mac. This is sometimes handy for when you're working on duplicated files and you can't remember where
you saved the last revision.

\subsection{Bounding Box Basics}
If you are new to design apps, such as OmniGraffle, you may not be familiar with what a \textit{bounding box}
is and how to use them. An object's bounding box appears when you select an object with the \textbf{Selection} tool.

Everything you add to the canvas—a shape, line, or an image—is surrounded by what's known as a
\textbf{bounding box}. A bounding box defines an object or selection's width and height, and consists of
eight selection handles which you can use to resize an object.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{res/og7_concepts_boundingbox01.png}
\end{figure}

A bounding box is ``drawn'' around one or more selected objects:
\begin{figure}[H]

  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{res/og7_concepts_boundingbox02.png}
\end{figure}
If the selected objects are part of a group, the bounding box has a light blue highlight:
\begin{figure}[H]

  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{res/og7_concepts_boundingbox03.png}
\end{figure}
Once selected, you can \textbf{click-and-drag} on any one of the selection handles to resize the object:
\begin{figure}[H]

  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{res/og7_concepts_boundingbox04.png}
\end{figure}

If you \textbf{Shift-click-and-drag} on any of the selection handles, the object (or selection or group)
resizes proportionally:
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{res/og7_concepts_boundingbox05.png}
\end{figure}
Press \textbf{Option-Shift} and then \textbf{click-and-drag} on any of the selection handles to
proportionally resize an object (or selection or group) based on its center point:
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
To deselect any selected objects, press \textbf{Esc} on your keyboard.
